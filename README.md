# python-api-challenge
I used Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Part I - WeatherPy

I created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

        Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
        Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
        Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
        Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
 
 I ran linear regression on each relationship. This time, separated the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees  latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

        Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
        Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
        Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
        Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
        Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
        Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
        Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
        Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Part II - VacationPy
